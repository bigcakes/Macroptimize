Macroptimize
=============

##### A plugin for Sublime Text 3 to make working with macros less clunky.

##### Allows for quick selection of any macro to run in Sublime packages, or easy repetition of the last macro.

## Installation

Install this plugin with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Macroptimize).

## Usage

Just ctrl+alt+z and select which macro to run or if you have already ran a macro, press ctrl+alt+x to run the last macro again!

Or select commands `Macroptimize: Select Macro` and `Macroptimize: Run Last Macro` in command palette.

## TODO

- Repeat until end of file setting (maybe even per macro)
- Replace current buffer macro with last run macro
- ~~Key binding for running last selected macro~~
